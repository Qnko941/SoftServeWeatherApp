# SoftServeWeatherApp

Please use http://localhost:8000/ to run this project.

I started it with Accuweather, but I faced difficulties parsing the JSON data and my registration key expired a couple of times, so I decided to switch to https://openweathermap.org, as the data there was way better organised and I found lots of information for it on google.
